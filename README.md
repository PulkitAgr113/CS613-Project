This project was done by [Pulkit Agarwal](https://github.com/PulkitAgr113) as part of the course Design and Implementation of Functional Programming Languages (CS613) under the supervision of [Prof. Amitabha Sanyal, IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~as/).

The project is based on the papers [Inductive Graphs and Functional Graph Algorithms](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/InductiveGraphs_JFP01.pdf) by Martin Erwig and [Algebraic Graphs with Class (Functional Pearl)](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper/releases/download/final/algebraic-graphs.pdf) by Andrey Mokhov. The report is based on study of these 2 papers, and their benefits over previous approaches. The implementation is done using the pre-existing fgl and alga libraries present in Haskell for the 2 papers respectively.
